\section{CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK}\label{sec:conclusion}
This work has defined the development of an online internet topology simulator. The simulator was used to simulate Africa's internet topology to evaluate two peering scenarios which African ISPs can peer. African ISPs peering at regional IXPs turns out to be the best scenario where the African ISPs could peer as the regional internet latency drops by 75\% and the inter-regional internet latency drops by 20\%. 

This work only considered the geographical position of an ISP to evaluate the peering scenario. However, there are various factors that affects ISP peering such as language spoken in a country, economic status of an ISP. Future work of this work should focus on integrating these factors in modelling the simulation algorithm to ensure that simulation results obtained are inclusive of all factors that affect ISP peering.
